# RNA-seq
Basic workflow for ATAC-seq analysis

This is a work-in-progress compilation of various commands and tools intended for an RNA-seq analysis workflow, largely based on [Michael Love's Bioconductor workflow](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/workflows/rnaseqGene/).

Attempt to run each command individually or in blocks after editing to match your own data architecture.
