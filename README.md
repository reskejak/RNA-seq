# RNA-seq
Basic workflow for RNA-seq analysis.

#### minimal_workflow_PE.sh, minimal_workflow_SE.sh, and downstream_analysis.R
Work-in-progress compilation of various commands and tools intended for an RNA-seq analysis workflow, largely based on [Michael Love's Bioconductor workflow](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/workflows/rnaseqGene/).

Attempt to run each command individually or in blocks after editing to match your own data architecture.

#### tuxedo_pipeline.sh
Archive of automated pipeline for RNA-seq quality control and [Cole Trapnell's Tuxedo Suite](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2012.016) analysis software. Generally considered outdated. This is an archive. Do not use for quantification purposes.
